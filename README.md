# SkinningTools

refactor of the original skinning tools
https://gumroad.com/l/skinningTools_PL

main goal of the tools is to make clean code that is ready for Python 3
maya code should be seperated in the Maya folder hopefully we can make some parts DCC agnostic to get the same or similar functionality in other dcc tools
